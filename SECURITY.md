## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainers at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### When to Report a Vulnerability

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in the project
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the project
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that the project depends on

### When Not to Report a Vulnerability

- You need help tuning the project's security parameters
- You need help applying security-related updates
- Your issue is not security-related

## Security Updates, Alerts and Bulletins

Security updates will be released as minor version updates. All security updates will be accompanied by a security advisory on GitHub.

## Security Considerations

When reporting a vulnerability, please do not:
- Break any applicable law or regulations
- Access unnecessary amounts of data
- Modify or delete data
- Cause harm to users or the environment
- Disclose the vulnerability to others until it has been fixed
